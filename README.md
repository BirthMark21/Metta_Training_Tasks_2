# Metta_Training_Tasks_2
This repository contains implementations of various list and expression operations in MeTTa, a pattern-matching language designed for symbolic AI and knowledge representation. The repository is structured into different files to organize functionalities such as list manipulations, expression reconstructions, and pattern matching.

##  Tasks Overview

### 1️⃣ **List Operations (list_operations.metta)**
- **Extract last element** of a list.  
- **Append an element** at the beginning.  
- **Append an element** at the end.  

### 2️⃣ **Expression Operations (expression_operations.metta)**
- Compute **list length**.  
- **Convert list** to a flat expression.  
- Find the **length of an expression**.  
- **Sum first elements** of two expressions.  

### 3️⃣ **Indexing & Slicing (indexing_slicing.metta)**
- **Select an element** by index.  
- **Slice an expression** by start and end index.  

### 4️⃣ **Reconstruct Expression (reconstruct_expression.metta)**
- **Rebuild expressions** using `car-atom`, `cdr-atom`, and `cons-atom`.  
- **Print elements** while reconstructing.
